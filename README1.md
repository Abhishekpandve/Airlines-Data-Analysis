# Airlines Data Analysis Using SQL and Python

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of airline data, utilizing both SQL and Python, to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the aviation industry. The primary focus is on maximizing profitability by examining revenue data, occupancy rates, and other relevant metrics.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Sources:** We have employed real-world airline data to ensure the accuracy and relevance of our analysis.

- **SQL Analysis:** The project includes SQL queries to extract and process data from a relational database. We'll explore SQL-based data manipulation, aggregation, and querying techniques.

- **Python Programming:** Python is utilized for data analysis and visualization. We'll employ popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to gain insights and create informative visualizations.

- **Key Metrics:** The project centers around key performance indicators such as total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft.

- **Profitability Optimization:** The analysis will help identify areas for improvement, recommend pricing strategies, and route optimizations to enhance airline profitability.

- **Customer Satisfaction and Safety:** While the project aims to maximize profitability, we also emphasize the importance of balancing financial gains with customer satisfaction and safety.

- **Data-Driven Approach:** We advocate a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization for sustainable growth and success in the competitive airline industry.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Extraction:** SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database.

2. **Data Analysis:** Python scripts for data analysis, including Pandas data manipulation and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
