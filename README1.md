# Airlines Data Analysis Using SQL and Python

## Overview

The goal of this data analysis project using sql would be to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability for the airline.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Sources:** We have utilized genuine aircraft information to guarantee the precision and pertinence of our analysis.

- **SQL Analysis:** The project includes SQL queries to extract and process data from a relational database. We'll explore SQL-based data manipulation, aggregation, and querying techniques.

- **Python Programming:** Python is used for data analysis  and visualization. We'll utilize well known libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to acquire experiences and make enlightening visualization.
- 
- **Key Metrics:**The task bases on key performance markers, for example, total revenue, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft.

- **Profitability Optimization:**  The analysis will assist with distinguishing regions for development, suggest estimating strategies, and course improvements to upgrade airline benefit.

- **Customer Satisfaction and Safety:**  While the undertaking means to augment productivity, we additionally stress the significance of offsetting financial benefits with consumer loyalty and security.

- **Data-Driven Approach:** We advocate a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization for sustainable growth and success in the competitive airline industry.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Extraction:** SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database.

2. **Data Analysis:** Python scripts for data analysis, including Pandas data manipulation and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. **Conclusions:** A summary of key findings and insights from the analysis, highlighting strategies for profitability optimization.

4. **Safety and Customer Satisfaction:** A section emphasizing the importance of balancing financial goals with customer happiness and safety.

5. **Contributing:** Instructions on how to contribute to this project.
